 <p>Welcome to this repository dedicated to building and understanding a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. This tutorial is designed to help you grasp the fundamental concepts of RL and apply them to train your very first model!</p>

<h2>Repository Contents</h2>

<p>This repository contains the following files:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>First Reinforcement Learning Model.ipynb</strong>: A comprehensive Jupyter Notebook tutorial that guides you through the basics of Reinforcement Learning, Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), experience replay, and Îµ-greedy exploration. This step-by-step guide also demonstrates how to create a custom labyrinth game environment for training and testing the RL model.</li>
    <li><strong>labyrinthe_1.py</strong>: A standalone Python script that you can use to train the RL model after completing the tutorial. This script includes the complete implementation of the game environment, DQN architecture, and the training loop for your convenience.</li>
</ol>

<p>By exploring this repository and following the tutorial, you will gain valuable insights into the world of RL and learn how to implement a working RL model that navigates a labyrinth, complete with walls, holes, and magic doors.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To begin your journey into Reinforcement Learning, follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clone this repository:<br><code>git clone https://github.com/GhaithMag/Introduction-to-Reinforcement-Learning.git</code></li>
    <li>Navigate to the repository folder and open the <code>First Reinforcement Learning Model.ipynb</code> file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:<br><code>cd Reinforcement-Learning-Model</code><br><code>jupyter notebook First Reinforcement Learning Model.ipynb</code></li>
    <li>Follow the tutorial to learn about RL concepts and build your model step by step.</li>
    <li>After completing the tutorial, try running the standalone Python script to train the model:<br><code>python labyrinthe_1.py</code></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this tutorial sparks your interest in Reinforcement Learning and provides you with the foundation to explore more advanced RL techniques and applications.</p>

<p>Happy learning! ðŸš€</p>
